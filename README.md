# blankRustPWA
Minimalistic PWA example on Rust

## Todo:  
* HTML + CSS + Service worker + wasm-bindgen  
* Dioxus  
* egui  
* Customize with CSS    

More Rust frontend frameworks to try:    
* Iced  
* Sauron  
* Leptos  
* Tauri  
* Yew  

## Why and what to prefer?  
The approach of creating a PWA first is remind the Lean Startup concept.  
Starting with a PWA PoC then develop it to matured state and then consider to make it a cross-platform or native app. And Rust is a possible choice for this.
